    <p>The GDPR is a European Union (EU) privacy law that affects businesses around the world. It regulates how any organization
        that is subject to the Regulation treats or uses the personal data of people located in the EU. Personal data is
        any piece of data that, used alone or with other data, could identify a person. If you collect, change, transmit,
        erase, or otherwise use or store the personal data of EU citizens, you'll need to comply with the GDPR. The GDPR
        will replace an older directive on data privacy, Directive 95/46/EC, and it introduces a few important changes that
        may affect MailChimp users.</p>
